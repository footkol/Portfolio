In this project, we will work with a dataset of Jeopardy questions, in order to figure out some patterns in those questions that could potentially improve our chances of winning this famous US tv show. 

We will be using the chi-squared test for categorical data. This test allows us to find the statistical significance of observing a set of categorical values.
