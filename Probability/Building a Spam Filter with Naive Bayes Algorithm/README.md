In this project, I am going to study the practical side of the multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm by building a spam filter for SMS messages. My goal is to write a program that classifies new messages with an accuracy greater than 80% â€” so I expect that more than 80% of the new messages will be classified correctly as spam or non-spam.
