Within this project I apply both exploratory and explanatory data visualization principles. 
These include:
- maximizing the data-ink ratio to create better graphs for an audience, 
- creating storytelling data using Matplotlib,
- creating visual patterns using Gestalt principles, 
- guiding the audience's attention with pre-attentive attributes, 
- using Matplotlib built-in styles.
