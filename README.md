Hello World!!!

This is my journey through the world of Data, with the help of Dataquest where I attempt to grasp all the skills and competence required to become a real world data analyst. 

Here I will be posting  projects which I have completed already, as well as those I am about to embark on. Some of them are based on well-known datasets available online. 

I would like to share this beautiful journey with the rest of the World and perhaps inspire someone, like I was inspired when I started this repository. 

To be continuedâ€¦
