In this project we will be creating the Autoencoder model for denoising handwritten images.

In this project we will be using MNIST dataset, further details can be found __[here]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)__

In PyTorch, an autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network that aims to learn efficient representations of data, typically without any supervision. It consists of two main components: an encoder and a decoder.

- The encoder takes in the input data and compresses it into a lower-dimensional representation known as the latent space.
- The decoder then tries to reconstruct the original input data from this compressed representation.

Autoencoders are often used for tasks such as data denoising, dimensionality reduction, and feature extraction. They are trained using unsupervised learning techniques, making them valuable tools for learning meaningful representations of data without the need for labelled examples.
