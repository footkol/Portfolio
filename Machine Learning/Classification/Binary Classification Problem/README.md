# Dataset
In this project we are working with the dataset from Kaggle named Credit card Details Binary Classification Problem.
The dataset can be found __[here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitudageri/credit-card-details/data)__.

# Problem Statement
Credit card approval datasets used in machine learning typically contain information about credit card applications and their approval decisions. These datasets are commonly employed to build predictive models that can help automate the credit approval process and assess the creditworthiness of applicants. We will create a model helping us to estimate credit card approval rate based on the features provided. 

# Tasks involved
In this project, our tasks will involve uploading the data, conducting exploratory data analysis, preparing the data, handling missing data, and addressing outliers. We will process both categorical and numerical data, applying the one-hot encoding technique and training logistic regression, as well as tree-based models. Additionally, we will address imbalanced 
data, select the appropriate model, tune hyperparameters, and apply the final model. Finally, we will deploy the model using Flask, create virtual environment on local machine and also using Docker and provide instructions on deploying the model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
